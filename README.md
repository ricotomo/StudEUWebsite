## About
StudEU (pronounced "study-you") was a Pennsylvania based consulting company founded by Moritz and Richard Walther in August 2020 to help Americans earn a degree oversees in Europe. The business was based on the idea that studying in Europe is cheaper, more fun and of higher quality. We faced issues finding the right revenue model despite several pivots. In the spirit of "fail fast, fail forward" we dissolved the company in July 2021 to focus on other ventures.
